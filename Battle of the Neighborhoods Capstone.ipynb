            "source": "The International is the premier esports tournament for the video game Dota 2, hosted and produced by the game's developer, Valve. It is being held annually starting from 2011 upto the present. The event has been attended and watched by fans across the globe.\n\nThe first iteration of the International was on August 1, 2011 and was held on Gamescom in cologne. The tournament was born due to re-allocation of marketing funds. Instead of doing traditional marketing through advertising, Valve opted to do a tournament instead, boasting a 1 million USD grand prize. Since then the tournament was held every year with the last iteration being held in Shanghai, China.\n\nThe tournament boast the largest prize pool in all of esports, giving out a total of 34 million USD in prizes in 2019. The prizepool is a result of a crowdfunding scheme called the battle pass. 25% of the purchases made from the battle pass goes into the prizepool, in which the community was able to raise more than 30 million to add to the prizepool.[1]\n\nThe International consists of 18 teams which came from 6 major regions which include: North America, South America, Southeast Asia, China, Europe and CIS. It is a spectacle that has been watched by millions of people. In 2019, the total peak viewers(excluding China) amounted to 1,968,497 and has an average viewership of 726,754.\nThe venues that the tournament was held on has been consistently sold-out.[2]\n\nThe next iteration of the International will be held on the Ericsson Globe, Stockholm, Sweden. It has a seating capacity of 16,000 people which is expected to sellout.[3] However, on April 30, 2020, Valve announced that the event would be cancelled due to the current Covid-19 pandemic and is possible to return on 2021.[4]"

It would leveraging data from Foursquare API to aquire information regarding Hotels, Food Venues and Pubs and processing that data so that it can be easily consumed by the spectators.\n\nWhat's the value of improving the esport experience?\n\nIt has been projected that esports are going to grow at unprecedented levels. According to a Goldman Sachs report[5], the monthly audience would reach 276 million by 2022. The audience is mostly young and digitally inclined, where 79% are under 35 yrs. old. In Dota 2, the audience is predominantly young to middle aged adults, hence the inclusion of Pubs. The total esport prizepool is projected to 413 million in 2022 and Dota 2 boast the highest of them all in 2019.\n\nImproving the experience of offline events would also improve the outlook of esports."

The data would be consisted of venues within the 10km range of the Ericsson Globe. There would be 3 primary datasets representing each venue category(hotel, food, pubs). The rationale for picking these specific category of venues because the target audience are sporting event spectators and not regular tourists. The International spans around 5-6 days of matches around 8 hours each day. Most of the time the spectator is inside the stadium and mostly only goes out to go back to their room or eat. The inclusion of hotels would help the audience plan where they are staying ahead of time since they would need to stay in Sweden for at least a week. The food venues would help them pick which venues they can eat. And pubs are for night meetups for the dota 2 community.\n\nBy covering these 3  major venues, the tourist guide would be able to meet most the audience's travel needs."
